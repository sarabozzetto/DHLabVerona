# DHLabVerona
Materials and [slides](https://simonerebora.github.io/DHLabVerona/#/) for the *Advanced Digital Humanities Lab* at the University of Verona.

## Learning outcomes

The laboratory aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills required to carry out articulated and interdisciplinary projects using the fundamental methodologies and technologies in Digital Humanities. At the end of the laboratory the students: - will be able to combine the previously acquired skills of programming, data and information management, and web development to autonomously implement complex Digital Humanities projects; - will know and will be able to apply a well-founded methodology for the planning and development of a Digital Humanities software project.

## Program

Main subject of the workshop will be the application of computational methods and tools for text analysis and data visualisation. Practical exercises with the programming languages R and Python will be accompanied by: (1) critical-theoretical reflections on the potential and limitations of the presented methods; (2) exemplifications of their application to a series of case studies (focusing on the phenomenon of "digital social reading").
Main topics:
- GitHub
- stylometry
- sentiment analysis
- topic modeling
- machine learning
- web scraping
- maps
