# Instructions to install RStudio on your computer

## 1. Install R

- Windows: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base)
- Mac: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx) 
  - to avoid issues with the Stylo package, you have to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) before installing R
- Linux (command line): `sudo apt install r-base-core`

## 2. Install RStudio

After having installed R, you can install RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

## Alternative solution: RStudio Cloud

For limited usage (max 25 hours per month) and with some limitations (e.g. Stylo's graphical interface not available), you can use RStudio without having to install anything through RStudio Cloud: [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/).  
It will work directly from your browser. You'll just need to register for a Free account.
