# Instructions to install RStudio on your computer

## 1. Install R

First of all, you will need to install R.  

- Windows: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base)
- Mac: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx) 
  - to avoid issues with the Stylo package, you have to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) before installing R
- Linux (command line): `sudo apt install r-base-core`

## 2. Install RStudio

After having installed R, you can install RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).  
Remember that RStudio is a graphical interface for efficient R programming.  
I suggest that you always use RStudio for your R programming!

## 3. Install Git

For the activities in the Lab, you will also need to install Git.  

- Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win (during the installation, leave all settings to default)
- Mac: https://git-scm.com/download/mac (suggested installation: via terminal with Homebrew: https://brew.sh/)
- Linux: https://git-scm.com/download/linux (install via command line)

## Alternative solution: RStudio Cloud

For limited usage (max 25 hours per month) and with some limitations (e.g. Stylo's graphical interface not available), you can use RStudio without having to install anything through RStudio Cloud: [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/).  
It will work directly from your browser. You'll just need to register for a Free account.
